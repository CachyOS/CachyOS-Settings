# The sysctl swappiness parameter determines the kernel's preference for pushing anonymous pages or page cache to disk in memory-starved situations.
# A low value causes the kernel to prefer freeing up open files (page cache), a high value causes the kernel to try to use swap space,
# and a value of 100 means IO cost is assumed to be equal.
vm.swappiness = 100

# The value controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory which is used for caching of directory and inode objects (VFS cache). 
# Lowering it from the default value of 100 makes the kernel less inclined to reclaim VFS cache (do not set it to 0, this may produce out-of-memory conditions)

# page-cluster controls the number of pages up to which consecutive pages are read in from swap in a single attempt. 
# This is the swap counterpart to page cache readahead. The mentioned consecutivity is not in terms of virtual/physical addresses, 
# but consecutive on swap space - that means they were swapped out together. (Default is 3)
# increase this value to 1 or 2 if you are using physical swap (1 if ssd, 2 if hdd)

# in-memory for longer than this interval will be written out next time a flusher thread wakes up
# (Default is 3000).

# This file contains the maximum number of memory map areas a process may have. Memory map areas are used as a side-effect of calling malloc, directly by mmap, mprotect, and madvise, and also when loading shared libraries.
# While most applications need less than a thousand maps, certain programs, particularly malloc debuggers, may consume lots of them, e.g., up to one or two maps per allocation.
