# THP Shrinker has been added in the 6.12 Kernel
# Default Value is 511
# THP=always policy vastly overprovisions THPs in sparsely accessed memory areas, resulting in excessive memory pressure and premature OOM killing
# 409 means that any THP that has more than 409 out of 512 (80%) zero filled filled pages will be split.
# This reduces the memory usage, when THP=always used and the memory usage goes down to around the same usage as when madvise is used, while still providing an equal performance improvement
