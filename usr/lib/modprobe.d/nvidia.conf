#
# NVreg_UsePageAttributeTable=1 (Default 0) - Activating the better memory
# management method (PAT). The PAT method creates a partition type table at a
# specific address mapped inside the register and utilizes the memory
# architecture and instruction set more efficiently and faster. If your system
# can support this feature, it should improve CPU performance.
#
# NVreg_InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations=0 (Default 1) - Disables clearing
# system memory allocation before using it for the GPU. Potentially improves
# performance, but at the cost of increased security risks. Write "options
# nvidia NVreg_InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations=1" in
# /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf, if you want to return the default value. Note:
# It is possible to use more memory (?)
#
# NVreg_DynamicPowerManagement=0x02 - Enables the use of dynamic power
# management for Turing generation mobile cards, allowing the dGPU to be
# powered down during idle time.
