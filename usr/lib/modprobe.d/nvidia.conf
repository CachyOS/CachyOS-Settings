#
# NVreg_UsePageAttributeTable=1 (Default 0) - Activating the better memory
# management method (PAT). The PAT method creates a partition type table at a
# specific address mapped inside the register and utilizes the memory
# architecture and instruction set more efficiently and faster. If your system
# can support this feature, it should improve CPU performance.
#
# NVreg_InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations=0 (Default 1) - Disables clearing
# system memory allocation before using it for the GPU. Potentially improves
# performance, but at the cost of increased security risks. Write "options
# nvidia NVreg_InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations=1" in
# /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf, if you want to return the default value. Note:
# It is possible to use more memory (?)
#
# NVreg_DynamicPowerManagement=0x02 - Enables the use of dynamic power
# management for Turing generation mobile cards, allowing the dGPU to be
# powered down during idle time.
#
#
# NVreg_EnableS0ixPowerManagement=1 (default 0) Enables S0ix for the NVIDIA GPU:
# lets the device enter deep,
# low-power idle states while the system uses s2idle (the S0 low-power idle path),
# reducing battery drainâ€”especially on laptops with recent Intel/AMD
# platforms and Turing/Ampere/Ada GPUs
#
# NVreg_RegistryDwords=RmEnableAggressiveVblank=1
# Reduce time spent in interrupt top half for low latency display interrupts
# by deferring the work later
