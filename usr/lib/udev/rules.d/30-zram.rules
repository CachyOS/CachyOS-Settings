TEST!="/dev/zram0", GOTO="zram_end"

# Since ZRAM stores all pages in compressed form in RAM, we should prefer
# preempting anonymous pages more than a page (file) cache.  Preempting file
# pages may not be desirable because a process may want to access a file at any
# time, whereas if it is preempted, it will cause an additional read cycle from
# the disk.
