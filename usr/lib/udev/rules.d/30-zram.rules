# When used with ZRAM, it is better to prefer page out only anonymous pages,
# because it ensures that they do not go out of memory, but will be just
# compressed. If we do frequent flushing of file pages, that increases the
# percentage of page cache misses, which in the long term gives additional
# cycles to re-read the same data from disk that was previously in page cache.
# This is the reason why it is recommended to use high values from 100 to keep
# the page cache as hermetic as possible, because otherwise it is "expensive"
# to read data from disk again. At the same time, uncompressing pages from ZRAM
# is not as expensive and is usually very fast on modern CPUs.
