# The sysctl swappiness parameter determines the kernel's preference for pushing anonymous pages or page cache to disk in memory-starved situations.

# --- Maximum Socket Buffer Size (Throughput Optimization) ---
# Increases the maximum window size for TCP/UDP.
# Benefit: Allows high-performance devices to saturate Gigabit+ and WAN links.
# Use Case: Prevents throttling in high-bandwidth apps like Syncthing (Large Syncs), Steam Downloads, and Sunshine/Moonlight (4K HDR Streams).

# Benefit: Improves throughput stability on all connections without app-specific tuning.
# Constraint: Safe for low-memory devices (4GB+ RAM) to prevent OOM conditions.

# Use Case: Smoother playback in Moonlight/Parsec and fewer re-transmits in WireGuard.

# --- TCP Write Limit (Anti-Bufferbloat) ---

# --- Aggressive Keepalives (NAT Persistence) ---
# Reduces the time before keepalive packets are sent (Default: 2 hours -> 60s).
